# I hate the Internet
        knowledge should from now on be free, we should not allow any barrier 
        whatsoever any more;

        everybody should not only be allowed, but also helped to develop his 
        capacities;

        the consum oriented society wherein we are compelled to live is NOT 
        free, nor correct, nor the best possible one, far from it. We must 
        help others, blinded by a well-concerted propaganda, to realise this.
